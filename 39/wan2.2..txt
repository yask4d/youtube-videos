Wan 2.2 AI Video Tool Overview
Prompt Formulas
Three structured approaches to generate videos:
Aesthetic Controls
Parameters to refine visual output:
Core Upgrade: Wan 2.2 offers enhanced video generation with improved fluidity, realism,
and speed. Supports Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video modes with cinematic controls.
Key Improvements:
Precise motion generation (human actions, expressions).
Better prompt adherence (multi-object scenes, spatial accuracy).
Professional cinematic aesthetics (lighting, color, composition).
1. Basic Formula: Subject + Scene + Motion
Example: "A cat (subject) in a garden (scene) jumping (motion)."
2. Advanced Formula: Subject (Details) + Scene (Details) + Motion (Details) +
Aesthetic Control + Stylization
Adds granular control (e.g., lighting, shot size).
3. Image-to-Video Formula: Motion Description + Camera Movement
Focuses on animating existing images (e.g., "Running + Pan left").
1. Light Source: Sunny, artificial, moonlight, firelight, etc.
2. Lighting Type: Soft, hard, top, side, underlighting.
3. Time of Day: Sunrise, dusk, night, etc.
4. Shot Size: Extreme close-up, wide shot, establishing shot.
5. Composition: Center-balanced, symmetrical, weighted (left/right).
6. Lens: Wide-angle, telephoto, fisheye, medium.
7. Color Tone: Warm, cool, saturated, desaturated.Dynamic Control
Stylization
Creative visual styles and effects:
